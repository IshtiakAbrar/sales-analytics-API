Create a MongoDB database with a collection named sales. Each document in the collection should have the following structure:


{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "product": "Product Name",
  "quantity": 5,
  "price": 10,
  "date": ISODate("2023-09-01T00:00:00Z")
}



Create a Mongoose model for the sales collection.


Build the following API endpoints:


GET /api/sales/total-revenue: Calculate and return the total revenue generated by all sales transactions.
GET /api/sales/quantity-by-product: Find and return the total quantity sold for each product.
GET /api/sales/top-products: Retrieve the top 5 products with the highest total revenue, along with their total revenue values.
GET /api/sales/average-price: Calculate and return the average price of products sold.
GET /api/sales/revenue-by-month: Group the sales data by month and year and calculate the total revenue for each month-year combination.
GET /api/sales/highest-quantity-sold: Find and return the product that had the highest quantity sold on a single day.
